# Azure OpenAI Integration Solution

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Error Handling in the Backend**
   - Updated the `_simulate_responses_api` method in `agents.py` to properly handle Azure OpenAI errors
   - Added detailed error messages when Azure OpenAI credentials are missing
   - Prevented silent fallback to simulated responses
   - Added proper error metadata to facilitate troubleshooting

2. **Enhanced Frontend to Display Connection Issues**
   - Added warning indicators in the ChatMessage component to show Azure OpenAI connection errors
   - Improved error visibility to help users understand when the system is not connected to Azure OpenAI

3. **Better Configuration Tools and Documentation**
   - Created a `configure-azure-openai.sh` helper script to easily set up Azure OpenAI credentials
   - Updated the README.md with instructions for setting up Azure OpenAI
   - Added credential checks to the run-demo.sh script to warn about missing credentials before running

## Testing the Solution

To test if the integration with Azure OpenAI is working correctly:

1. **Configure Azure OpenAI Credentials**:
   ```bash
   ./configure-azure-openai.sh
   ```
   Enter your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL and API key when prompted.

2. **Run the Demo**:
   ```bash
   ./run-demo.sh
   ```

3. **Test the Chat**:
   - Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
   - Type a message and send it
   - If configured correctly, you should receive responses from Azure OpenAI
   - If there are issues, you'll see detailed error messages explaining what's wrong

4. **Verify Azure OpenAI Connection**:
   - Check the backend console logs for "Successfully received response from Azure OpenAI" message
   - Look for any error messages that might indicate configuration issues

## Troubleshooting

If you're still getting default responses or errors:

1. **Check your Azure OpenAI subscription**:
   - Ensure your Azure subscription is active
   - Verify your Azure OpenAI resource is properly provisioned
   - Confirm that the deployment name matches what you entered in the configuration

2. **Verify the Deployment Name**:
   - Make sure the model deployment name you entered exists in your Azure OpenAI resource
   - The default is "gpt-4o" but your deployment might have a different name

3. **Check API Version Compatibility**:
   - The default API version is "2025-04-01-preview"
   - If you're getting version-related errors, try changing to a different API version
   - You can do this by editing the .env file directly

4. **Restart the Application**:
   - After making changes to the .env file, restart the application using run-demo.sh
